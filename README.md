# 0ty

_Pronounced "Naughty"_

> Node script to detect and replace naughty words in a string.

## Installation

```bash
npm i -s 0ty
# or
yarn add 0ty
```

## Dataset

0ty draws from the two datasets employed in [cuss's](https://github.com/words/cuss) English dataset: [Luis von Ahnâ€™s Research Group (Carnegie Mellon)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/resources/) and [Wikipedia's List of Ethnic Slurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_slurs). It further draws on [Facebook](https://www.freewebheaders.com/bad-words-list-and-page-moderation-words-list-for-facebook/) and [YouTube's](https://www.freewebheaders.com/youtube-blacklist-words-free-and-youtube-comment-moderation/) comment blacklists provided by [FreeWebHeaders](https://www.freewebheaders.com).

All words have been hand-tagged with one or more categories which aim to describe the nature of vulgarity which the word may represent.

Disagree with the categorization of a word? Feel free to submit a pull request or open a discussion.

### Tags

- `taboo_body_part`
- `vulgar`
- `insult`
- `sexual`
- `homophobic`
- `transphobic`
- `racist`
- `scatological`
- `misogynist`
- `nazi`
- `animal_cruelty`
- `violent`

### Note on Contextual/Informational

Some words are tagged with an additional tag of `contextual` or `informational`. These are cases where the context of a word in older forms of English _may_ be unoffensive. In similar fashion, words which may be used to present historical or otherwise educational information are tagged with the tag `informational`.

For example, `breast` and `booby` (as in the bird) are both include an `informational` tag whereas `boobs` is not. In a similar sense, `ass` includes

## Usage

```js
import Naughty from '0ty';

const naughty = new Naughty();

const [hasNaughtyWord, info] = naughty.detect(`Dammit Jim, I'm a doctor not a bricklayer!`);

if (hasNaughtyWord) {
  console.log(info);
  process.exit(1);
}
```

### Example Settings

The following settings would be recommended for discussion board moderation which is focused on World War II:

```js
const naughty = new Naughty({
  nazi: ['informational'],
});
```

Words should never be added that do not have _some_ relevant source indicating that the word is vulgar or offensive[^1]. Offensive should be defined as words which are generally off-limits to the majority of the public, are considered inappropriate for children, or target a [protected class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_group#United_States).
